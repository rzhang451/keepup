## Background
KeepUp is an easy to use fitness app. Users of all levels and needs will find a video course that meets their needs. 

The goal of this app is to lower the barriers to fitness and allow users to exercise anywhere, anytime.

Our app can plan your running route when you're outdoors and provide you with suitable videos when you're indoors. In our app's community, users can see other users sharing their workouts to inspire more users to join them. Our app also provides users with an agenda page to encourage themselves to keep exercising.
